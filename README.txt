FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS WERE NOT SHOWN IN THE PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I USED THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTION:
THE HEADEER FILE IS NAMED AFTER A CERTAIN COMPANY NAME AS IN "Microsoft.csv" 
THE INVOICE LINES FILE IS NAMED THE COMPANY NAME + DETAILS AS IN "MicrosoftDetails.csv"

AND OF COURSE ONLY THE INVOICE HEADER FILE IS SELECTED DURING THE LOADING PROCESS
